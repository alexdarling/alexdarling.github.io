        <h1>Converting Video Captions to text files</h1>
        <p>Websites that offer captioning services like Wistia will give you captions as an SRT file. You can open SRT files in a text editor, but if you want to turn those SRT files into a block of text you will be stuck with something that looks like this:</p>

        <div style="font-family:monospace; background-color: #DDDDDD">
          1
          00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,750
          The Tale of Sir Robin

          2
          00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,750
          So each of the knights 
          went their separate ways.

          3
          00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,750
          Sir Robin rode north,
          through the dark forest of Ewing...

        </div>

        And so on. Someone could technically read that, but it's an awful user experience and I'd be surprised if it didn't confuse search engines. If we could get it to display like this instead:

        <div style="font-family:monospace; background-color: #DDDDDD">
          The Tale of Sir Robin.

          So each of the knights went their separate ways. Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing...
        </div>

        That would be ideal.
