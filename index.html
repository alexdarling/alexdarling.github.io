      <h1>Digital Marketing Portfolio</h1>

      <p>As a digital marketer I have worked with a variety of law firms on SEO, link building, social media, and website content updates. I am persistent and focused, prioritizing goals and efficiency on each project. In the last year, I have dramatically improved company processes and facilitated content marketing strategies</p>

      <p>In this portfolio I have included a deeper description of my work in SEO and digital marketing, and the tools I created along the way. I can't speak about specific clients publically, but if you want to discuss my work further, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:aldarling@hotmail.com">aldarling@hotmail.com</a>. You can also view my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandertdarling">LinkedIn profile</a> and for additional professional background and <a href="https://github.com/alexdarling/">my GitHub account</a> for other contributions I have made.</p>

      <h2>SEO and Digital Marketing</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Link Building and Content Strategy</li>
          <p>At Mockingbird, I participated in company meetings to discuss link building campaigns that focused on clients' major cases. We went over content plans, outreach logistics, target audiences, and the account executive used the results of the brainstorm to direct the link building campaign. For smaller link building campaigns, I used results from our clients' analytics to suggest content ideas to the account executives. Throughout the process I maintained / updated content, built / managed contact lists, and performed the outreach and follow-up.</p>
          <li>Technical Audits</li>
          <p>Technical audits were one of the first steps we took when working with a new client. At the beginning of engagement, I looked at SEO benchmarks like page speed, HTML structure, and basic authority statistics. I also performed content audits manually and with Siteliner. These evaluations helped us determine our SEO and content goals. On the external side, I also audited the presence of firms in local directories (such as BBB, Infogroup, Factual, etc.) and attorneys in lawyer directories. This directed our "low hanging fruit" approach for smaller-scale link building and NAP cleanup.</p>
          <li>URL redirects</li>
          <p>A common issue our clients had was a large volume of URLs that were supposed to point to a valid page, but no longer did. Most of the time this was due to URLs that changed due to website migrations, but occasionally clients would take a page down or receive an incorrect external link. I took the lead role in researching and implementing URL redirects for our clients, working with our hosting provider to set up redirects for several complete website migrations.</p>
          <li>Monitoring Analytics </li>
          <p>One of the most common tasks at Mockingbird was watching client analytics, intake systems, and website health on a weekly basis to check for problems and identify trends in traffic. When traffic fell significantly, we looked deeper in client analytics to look for patterns in the missing traffic.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools and Updated Processes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Website migration process</li>
          <p>I created an automated process in Python for scraping websites, extracting page contents, and uploading the pages to new client sites. In addition to this, I created methods of updating internal links and creating URL redirects to speed up the website migration process. This process was used for two 500+ page migrations, cutting the time required down from days to hours. It is now the standard for any website migration where we can't access our clients' content (Ex: <a href="https://www.scorpion.co/">Scorpion</a> will not allow us to access the content on their custom CMS).</p>
          <li><a href="convert-video-captions-to-text.html">Converting video captions to text files</a></li>
          <p>I created a tool in Javascript for converting video captions as SubRip files (*.srt) into blocks of text. The tool was used to create text out of video transcripts so we could add the content to a site so search engines could recognize it more easily.</p>
          <li><a href="http://mockingbird.marketing/review-markup-generator/">Automatic review Schema markup</a></li>
          <p>I created a tool in Javascript for adding <a href="https://schema.org/Review">Schema markup</a> to reviews we received from clients according to <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/reviews">Google's review markup guidelines</a>. I used this tool to add reviews to testimonials page for several clients.</p>
        </ul>
