      <h1>Digital Marketing Portfolio</h1>

      <p>As a digital marketer I have worked with a variety of law firms on SEO, linkbuilding, social media, and website content updates. I am persistent and focused, prioritizing goals and efficiency on each project. In the last year, I have dramatically improved company processes and and facilitated content marketing strategies</p>

      <p>In this portfolio I have included a deeper description of work, and tools I created while working in SEO and digital marketing. You can also view my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandertdarling">LinkedIn profile</a> for additional professional background.</p>

      <h2>SEO and Digital Marketing</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Linkbuilding and Content Strategy</li>
          <p>At Mockingbird, I participated in company meetings to discuss linkbuilding campaigns that focused on clients' major cases. We went over content plans, outreach logistics, target audiences, and the account executive used the results of the brainstorm to direct the linkbuilding campaign. For smaller linkbuilding campaigns, I used results from our clients' analytics to suggest content ideas to the account executives. Throughout the process I maintained / updated content, built / managed contact lists, and performed the outreach and follow-up.</p>
          <li>Technical Audits</li>
          <p>Technical audits are one of the first steps we take when working with a new client. At the beginning of engagement, I looked at SEO benchmarks like page speed, HTML structure, and basic authority statistics. I also performed content audits manually and with Siteliner. These evaluations helped us determine SEO and content goals with our clients. On the external side, I also audited the presence of firms in local directories (such as BBB, Infogroup, Factual, etc.) and attorneys in lawyer directories. This directed our "low hanging fruit" approach for smaller-scale linkbuilding and NAP cleanup.</p>
          <li>URL redirects</li>
          <p>A common issue our clients had was a large volume of URLs that were supposed to point to a valid page, but no longer did. Most of the time this was due to URLs that changed due to website migrations, but occasionally clients would take a page down or receive an incorrect external link. I took the lead role in researching and implementing URL redirects for our clients, working with our hosting provider to set up redirects for several 100+ page website migrations.</p>
          <li>Monitoring Analytics </li>
          <p>One of the most common tasks at Mockingbird was watching client analytics, intake systems, and website health on a weekly basis to check for problems and identify trends in traffic. When traffic fell significantly, we looked deeper in client analytics to look for patterns in the missing traffic.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools and Updated Processes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Website migration process</li>
          <p>Created an automated process for scraping websites, extracting page contents, and uploading the pages to new client sites. Combined with processes for updating internal links and creating redirects to speed up the website migration process. This is now the standard for any website migration without content on hand.</p>
          <li><a href="convert-video-captions-to-text.html">Converting video captions to text files</a></li>
          <p>Created a tool for converting video captions as SubRip files (*.srt) into blocks of text. Used the tool to add video content as text on client websites.</p>
          <li><a href="http://mockingbird.marketing/review-markup-generator/">Automatic review Schema markup</a></li>
          <p>Created a tool for adding Schema markup to client reviews. Used the tool to add reviews to testimonials pages.</p>
        </ul>
